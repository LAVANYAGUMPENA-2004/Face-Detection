# Face-Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting human faces in images or live webcam video using Python and OpenCV. 
It utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers, a machine learning-based approach, for identifying facial features.

## Features
Detects human faces in static images or real-time video
Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes
Simple and easy to run

## Requirements
The project requires Python, the OpenCV library, and the Haar Cascade XML file for face detection.

## Installation
Clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and ensure the necessary XML file is in the working directory.

## Usage
The script can detect faces from either a static image file or a live webcam stream. It displays the output with rectangles drawn around the detected faces.

## Script Structure
The main script loads the Haar Cascade Classifier, reads the input source (image or webcam), detects faces using OpenCVâ€™s built-in methods, and displays the result.

## Contributing
Suggestions for improving the project, such as adding more detection capabilities or optimizing performance, are welcome.
